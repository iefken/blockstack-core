Blockstack is a new decentralized internet where you own your data and your apps run locally without remote servers. 

Blockstack provides decentralized services for naming/DNS, identity, authentication and storage. Developers can use JavaScript libraries to build serverless apps and they don't need to worry about managing infrastructure.

For more info on Blockstack see: http://github.com/blockstack/blockstack

**Blockstack Core is the reference implementation of Blockstack.** It is responsible for processing blockchain transactions, creating virtualchain state, and building the peer network amongst other things. Blockstack Core provides a RESTful interface for clients and also comes with a command-line-interface (CLI).

## Installing Blockstack

There are two major supported methods for installing `blockstack`: our `apt` repo or a `pip install`.


### `pip` Installation 

You should use `pip2` if you have it instead of `pip`. Blockstack is built against Python `2.7`.

For Mac:

```bash
# Install blockstack
$ pip2 install blockstack --upgrade
```

For Debian & Ubuntu:

```bash
# Install dependancies
$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y python-pip python-dev libssl-dev libffi-dev rng-tools libgmp3-dev
$ sudo pip2 install pyparsing

# Install blockstack
$ sudo pip2 install blockstack --upgrade
```

For SUSE and openSUSE:

```bash
# Install dependancies
$ sudo zypper update && zypper install rng-tools gcc python-devel python2-pip libffi-devel libopenssl-devel

# Install blockstack
$ sudo pip install blockstack --upgrade 
```

To install the `blockstack-browser`, [follow the instructions](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack-browser) over on the repository.

### `apt` Installation

```bash
# Add our apt repository
$ wget -qO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blockstack/packaging/master/repo-key.pub | sudo apt-key add -
$ echo "echo 'deb http://packages.blockstack.com/repositories/ubuntu/ xenial main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/blockstack.list" | sudo -E bash -

# Install blockstack
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install blockstack
```

To install the `blockstack-browser`, [follow the instructions](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack-browser) over on the repository.

### Setting up your install

If this is your first time installing blockstack first run `blockstack setup` and follow the prompts. Use the defaults for all of the options.

> NOTE: This process generates a wallet. *BE SURE TO SAVE THE WALLET PASSWORD YOU TYPE IN*.

Next you need to start the [`blockstack api`](https://blockstack.github.io/blockstack-core/) server:

```
$ blockstack api start
```

Now, you can test your installation by trying:

```
$ blockstack info 
```

which should display the last block processed and the latest consensus hash.

### Running a `blockstack-core` instance

After installation, you can (optionally) do a fast-sync that quickly syncs a local `blockstack-core` node with the Atlas network:

```bash
# Download the Atlas snapshot
$ blockstack-core --debug fast_sync http://fast-sync.blockstack.org/snapshot.bsk
```

And start Blockstack Core to index the blockchain:

```bash
# To start the server
$ blockstack-core --debug start

# Read the server logs
$ tail -f ~/.blockstack-server/blockstack-server.log
```

Next, visit the [basic usage docs](https://blockstack.org/docs) and [extended usage docs](https://blockstack.org/docs) to learn how to register names of your own, as well as transfer them and associate data with them.

If you encounter any technical issues in installing or using Blockstack, please [search the open issues](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack-core/issues) and start a new one if your issue is not covered. 

#### Support for Integration Tests and Regtest Environment

Our integration test suite allows you to easily get a regtest environment up and running with Blockstack, and the above `apt` package includes the suite. However, you'll need to install `bitcoind` and `sqlite3` for the tests to execute properly. For that you'll need to add bitcoin's PPA (or install it otherwise).

```
$ sudo apt install software-properties-common
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install sqlite3 bitcoind
```

## Development Status

**v0.14.2** is the current stable release of Blockstack Core (available on the master branch).<br>
**v0.14.3** is the next release candidate for Blockstack Core (available on the [v0.14.3 branch](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack-core/tree/rc-0.14.3)).

Most of the development is happening in the [v0.14.3 branch](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack-core/tree/rc-0.14.3). Please submit all
pull requests to that branch.

In the list of [release notes](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack-core/tree/master/release_notes) you can find what has changed in these versions.

## Blockstack Docs

If you have high-level questions about Blockstack, try [searching our forum](https://forum.blockstack.org) and start a new question if your question is not answered there.

## API Docs

A local core node will expose a RESTful API after starting the api with `blockstack api start`.
Documentation for that lives [here](https://blockstack.github.io/blockstack-core/), which is generated from blueprint markdown [here](docs/api-specs.md).

## Contributing

We welcome any small or big contributions! Please take a moment to
[review the guidelines for contributing to open source](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/) in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

**Developers**:  You can try out Blockstack Core in a local sandbox using our [integration test framework](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack-integration-tests).

You can install the latest release candidate by:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack-core.git
$ blockstack-core/images/scripts/debian-release-candidate.sh
```

## Running in Docker

> _*WARNING*_: This install path is currently for developers only. 

To run the Blockstack API and the Blockstack Browser in docker containers is easy! There is also a provided CLI: `launcher`. The CLI will pull down the images from our [Quay image repository](https://quay.io/organization/blockstack). If you want to build the API image locally run `./launcher build`. The browser image and build script are in the [`blockstack-browser`](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack-browser) repository.

```bash
# First run the setup command. This will create a `$HOME/.blockstack` directory to store your Blockstack Core API config and wallet
$ ./launcher setup <password>

# Next you can start the Blockstack Core API
$ ./launcher start <password>

# Finally start the Blockstack Browser
$ ./launcher browser

# Now open your browser to `localhost:8888` to view the blockstack browser!

# When you are done you can clean up your environment by running
$ ./launcher stop
```
